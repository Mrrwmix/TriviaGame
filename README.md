## Description of the Problem

Creating a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or time runs out. If the player selects the correct answer, a congratulatory gif appears. However, if the wrong answer is selected, then a different gif is displayed. Similarly, if a user doesn't answer in time, yet another gif will appear. Regardless of what happens, the next question displays after a few seconds. The final screen shows the number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions.

## How I Solved It

Figuring out how to work with intervals and timeouts were the main challenges here. Various functions were created for answering questions, displaying the correct answers, disabling buttons, showing different screens, and allowing for a reset function.

## Technical approach

Came up with all of the questions first. Next, made sure the intervals and timeouts were working. Lastly, disabled answer selections after 1 click and created the restart function.
